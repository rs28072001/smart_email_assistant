## 🗂️ File-by-File Purpose and Functionality

### 1. state.py - Data Structure Definition

```python
# PURPOSE: Define the data model that flows through the entire system
class EmailState(TypedDict):
    email: EmailMessage          # Input email data
    intent: str                  # Classified intent (complaint/request/feedback/inquiry)
    summary: str                 # 2-3 line email summary
    memory_context: str          # Conversation history
    reply_subject: str           # Generated reply subject
    reply_body: str              # Generated reply body
    escalate: bool               # Escalation decision
    confidence: float            # Classification confidence
```

**What we're doing:** Creating a strongly-typed state object that ensures data consistency as it moves through different processing nodes. This is like a "data container" that gets passed between workflow steps.

---

### 2. config.py - System Configuration

```python
# PURPOSE: Centralize all configuration settings
class Config:
    LLM_MODEL = "gpt-4o"                    # Which AI model to use
    MAX_HISTORY_LENGTH = 5                   # How many past conversations to remember
    COMPLAINT_ESCALATION_THRESHOLD = 0.8     # When to escalate complaints
```

**What we're doing:** Creating a single source of truth for all system settings. This makes the system easily configurable without changing code.

---

### 3. memory_manager.py - Conversation Memory

```python
# PURPOSE: Remember past conversations with each email sender
class MemoryManager:
    def load_memory(self, email_from):    # Load past conversations
    def save_memory(self, email_from):    # Save new conversation
    def get_memory_context(self):         # Format history for LLM
```

**What we're doing:** Implementing short-term memory that remembers the last 5 interactions with each person. This allows the system to provide context-aware responses like "I see we discussed this last week..."

---

### 4. nodes.py - Processing Steps

```python
# PURPOSE: Individual processing units that transform the email data

class EmailNodes:
    def classify_intent_node()     # Step 1: Understand email purpose
    def summarize_node()           # Step 2: Create brief summary
    def memory_node()              # Step 3: Retrieve conversation history
    def generate_reply_node()      # Step 4: Create appropriate response
    def decision_node()            # Step 5: Decide if human needed
```

**What we're doing:** Breaking down the complex email processing task into smaller, manageable steps. Each node has a single responsibility.

---

### 5. main.py - Workflow Orchestration

```python
# PURPOSE: Connect all nodes into a cohesive workflow
class SmartEmailAssistant:
    def _build_graph(self):        # Create the processing pipeline
    def process_email(self):       # Execute the entire workflow
```

**What we're doing:** Using LangGraph to create a directed workflow where data flows from one node to another in sequence, with each node transforming the state.

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Workflow Execution

### Step 1: Input Reception

```json
{
  "from": "customer@example.com",
  "subject": "Payment failed",
  "body": "Hi, my payment isn't working..."
}
```

**Action:** System receives raw email data in JSON format.

---

### Step 2: Intent Classification

**Node:** `classify_intent_node`

- **Input:** Email body text
- **Processing:** LLM analyzes the email to determine purpose
- **Output:** `{"intent": "complaint", "tone": "frustrated", "confidence": 0.9}`

**What happens:** The AI reads the email and categorizes it as:
- **Complaint:** Problem that needs solving
- **Request:** Asking for something
- **Feedback:** Sharing opinions
- **Inquiry:** Seeking information

---

### Step 3: Email Summarization

**Node:** `summarize_node`

- **Input:** Email body + classified intent
- **Processing:** LLM extracts key points
- **Output:** "Customer reports payment failure, frustrated about service disruption"

**What happens:** Creates a concise summary that captures the essence of the email for quick understanding.

---

### Step 4: Memory Retrieval

**Node:** `memory_node`

- **Input:** Sender's email address
- **Processing:** Loads past conversations from memory.json
- **Output:** "Last week: Customer asked about billing. We updated their payment method."

**What happens:** Provides context about previous interactions to avoid repetitive conversations.

---

### Step 5: Response Generation

**Node:** `generate_reply_node`

- **Input:** Summary + Intent + Memory context
- **Processing:** LLM creates appropriate response based on rules:
  - **Complaint** → Empathetic tone: "I understand your frustration..."
  - **Request** → Helpful tone: "I can help you with that..."
  - **Feedback** → Appreciative tone: "Thank you for sharing..."
  - **Inquiry** → Informative tone: "Here's the information you requested..."

**What happens:** Generates a human-like, context-aware email response.

---

### Step 6: Escalation Decision

**Node:** `decision_node`

- **Input:** Intent + Confidence score
- **Processing:** Applies business rules
- **Output:** `{"escalate": false}`

**What happens:** Automatically decides if the issue needs human intervention:
- **Escalate if:** Complaint + Low confidence OR Angry tone + Complex issue

---

### Step 7: Final Output

```json
{
  "subject": "Re: Payment failed",
  "body": "Hi there, I understand your frustration...",
  "escalate": false,
  "intent": "complaint"
}
```

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
**Why:** Each node can be tested, modified, or replaced independently without affecting the entire system.

### 2. State Management
**Why:** Using a typed state ensures data consistency and makes the workflow predictable.

### 3. Memory Persistence
**Why:** Storing conversation history in JSON files provides short-term context without complex database setup.

### 4. Configurable Escalation
**Why:** Business rules for escalation can be easily adjusted without code changes.

### 5. LLM Prompt Engineering
**Why:** Carefully designed prompts ensure consistent, professional responses across different email types.

## 💡 Real-World Example Walkthrough

### Scenario: Sarah's payment is failing for the second time.

**Input Email:**
```json
{
  "from": "sarah@example.com",
  "subject": "Payment failed again!",
  "body": "This is the second time my payment has failed. Last week you said it was fixed!"
}
```

### Processing Steps:

1. **Classify:** Detects intent: "complaint", tone: "frustrated", confidence: 0.95
2. **Summarize:** "Customer reports recurring payment failure, frustrated about previous unresolved issue"
3. **Memory:** Retrieves last week's conversation about billing updates
4. **Generate Reply:** Creates empathetic response acknowledging the recurring issue
5. **Decision:** `escalate: true` (because it's a recurring complaint)

### Final Output:
```json
{
  "subject": "Re: Payment failed again!",
  "body": "Hi Sarah, I'm very sorry you're still experiencing payment issues...",
  "escalate": true,
  "intent": "complaint"
}
```
